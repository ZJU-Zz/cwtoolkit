 1) Sometimes cwstats.py takes a long time to do fft and filtering.  You can
    use the -f option to get around this

 2) Adding noise isn't really working now -- it seems to just destroy the
    entire signal, but I haven't really looked at it much

 3) Fix the tolerance setting.  It's sort of meaningless now as it seems
    that either a signal works up to ~100, or only works at around 1-2

 4) cwstats still has trouble decoding noisy signals from off the radio
