cwtoolkit version 0.2b
joshua davis (cwtoolkit -at- covert.codes)

This was designed for Linux, with Python 2.7
This release is a beta.  Don't use it for production.  This was created for
a covert channel proof of concept project, which may be found on http://covert.codes

Required packages include: numpy, scipy, and scikits.audiolab

cwstats.py: Decode and generate statistics for Morse code from a wav audio file.
			Statistics include the average and standard deviation for intervals
			(dots, dashes, voids).

cwtx.py:    Generate Morse code and optionally apply statistical variation and noise to it.
			E.g. you can determine the statistics of a signal using cwstats.py, then apply
			those statistics to a computer generated message using this tool.  Gaussian
			noise can be added with user defined parameters.  The cwtxt.py statfile can be
			generated by cwstats.py (-o STATFILE).  If statistics are given to cwtxt.py via
			the -s switch, it will ignore the -w wpm switch and generate 'characterized'
			output; that is, the signal elements will be formulated according to the
			statistics in STATFILE.  We use a normal distribution for this.


 The -h switch gives help for any of the commands.

 The transmitter and receiver now include the capability to send covert messages.  This is done
by varying the timing of the overt (carrier) message.  See -h for usage information.
