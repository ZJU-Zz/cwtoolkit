This was designed for Linux, with Python 2.7

cwstats.py: Decode and generate statistics for Morse code from a wav audio file.
			Statistics include the average and standard deviation for intervals
			(dots, dashes, voids).

cwtx.py:    Generate Morse code and optionally apply statistical variation and noise to it.
			E.g. you can determine the statistics of a signal using cwstats.py, then apply
			those statistics to a computer generated message using this tool.  Gaussian
			noise can be added with user defined parameters.  The cwtxt.py statfile can be
			generated by cwstats.py (-o STATFILE).  If statistics are given to cwtxt.py via
			the -s switch, it will ignore the -w wpm switch and generate 'characterized'
			output; that is, the signal elements will be formulated according to the
			statistics in STATFILE.  We use a normal distribution for this.


 The -h switch gives help for any of the commands.
